# Argument against the rational atheist ecologist
Ecology is an ideology that believes that non-human biological entities are worthy of a higher moral consideration. Some of the most extreme ecologist groups even believe that human extinction is desirable for nature to prosper.

A person that embraces ecologism must also believe that humans are moraly capable to choose to protect non-human life. An ecologist, therefore, believes that:
 1. Humans are aware or reflect a Universal Ethical Code that is independent of human existence or 
 2. Human nature is the only known source of Ethics (either relativistic or not, natural or cultural). 

Atheists who embrace modern science must also embrace evolution, which is moved mainly by natural selection and has no moral ways by itself, but its only "guide" is survival and reproduction. Of course, an atheist as individual does have morals, but he cannot logically see morality as a natural or universal trait that guides evolution, even if it can be a product of evolution, as human ethics are.

Therefore, atheists can logically accept the last statement previously numbered: only intelligent beings like humans can be rational sources of ethical consideration for nature; no irrational animal can be consciously aware of Ecologism.

Therefore, atheists who embrace ecologism must logically accept these statements:
 1. Evolution driven by natural selection is morally blind; nature has no morals or ethics by itself. 
 2. Only humans are capable and aware of ethical consideration for nature; only rational beings can be ecologists.
 3. Morals and ethics, including ecologist ethics, are byproducts of evolution.


**Conclusion**
Since humans are the source of ethics, the atheist ecologist must believe that human beings are morally superior to nature in order to accept the ecologist ideology, which can only be embraced by rational beings. However, since evolution is blind and only survival and reproduction matters at the end, an atheist cannot see humans as morally superior, since morality is just a survival tactic just as any other from any other species. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the ecologist ideology and the atheist notion of evolution.

Therefore,
 1. A rational atheist cannot be an ecologist, unless he is irrational or protects nature for selfish human survival reasons.
    This is key because that would imply ecologism is lastly just another selfish way to explote nature.
 2. An ecologist cannot believe that only humans are source of morals, and therefore he cannot be an atheist.
 3. An ecologist must embrace the notion of Universal Ethics, independent of any human being.
    Since the natural is morally blind, he most embrace the supernatural. He cannot be an atheist and ecologist at the same time.
